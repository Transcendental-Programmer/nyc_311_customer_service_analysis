# NYC 311 Service Request Data Analysis

## Overview

NYC 311's mission is to provide quick and easy access to all New York City government services and information while offering the best customer service. This project involves analyzing service request data to uncover patterns and insights.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project include:

- Importing and preprocessing NYC 311 service request data.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand major complaint types and response times.
- Utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and predict patterns in service requests.
- Conducting correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables in the dataset.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning techniques such as clustering, classification, and time series analysis are employed to gain deeper insights into service request data. Examples include predicting complaint types and analyzing response times using regression models.

## Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis is utilized to uncover relationships between different variables in the dataset, aiding in understanding factors influencing service request outcomes.

## Tools Used
